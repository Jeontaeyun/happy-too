### (02) PROJECT Purpose

 I'm going to use TypeScript which is useful to develope a large scale application. Because Our next project is focusing on a stability. It is helpful when we are developing restaurant dashboard which is more likely to be extended. That's the reason why I'm use Typescript

## 03. PROJECT Contemplation

### (01) Using React Native

 It's my first time to use react-native. So, It's a little bit awesome to make mobile application. And I notice that I use react-native-nvigation for routing (In this case, it called Navigation). And at react-native, we got to use Native Component like < View >, < Text />. So we need to study about native component.

 - For routing at react-native, We got to use navigation library like react-native-navigation

 - For using react, We need to study about the Native Component

### (02) Reviewing about login process

I reviewed about login process with Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js. I think the Passporrt.js is super awesome library for the authentication. it have many Authentication strategy and it is really powerful. Of course, I am going to learn about vanilla login process and Federated Identity, but it's really good to use. Let's remember, Don't need to make wheels.

> **Federated Identity** <br/> a Kind of Authentication Strategy like Google Login, Facebook Login
